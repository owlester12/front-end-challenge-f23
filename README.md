I've implemented all of the required features, as well as some additional features such as ranking of courses with drag and drop menu, allowing users to decide how they want to interact with course descriptions, making 2 carts (primary and alternative), and making the website mobile responsive.

I used TypeScript with React along with Redux Toolkit for state management.

I put a lot of work into updating my submission from last semester. I really hope that I am selected to be a part of Penn Labs!
